                <p class="bulk">WolfieSync is a website where Stony Brook students and faculty can find potential collaborators for a project they’re working on.</br>The website and application would be accessible to all students through their Stony Brook email login. Accountability would be built in by feedback </br>post collaboration; students will also be able to attest to other students' skills and talents through positive testaments, or badges, linked to their profile. </br>It’s possible that professors can also access the site and app to find assistants, interns for outside jobs, or for a specific project.</p>
